    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Who Is behind Lionheart Finances?</h2>
    <p>My name is Laksh Singh, and I'm deeply committed to empowering younger generations to take control of their financial futures as early as possible. Finance has been a lifelong passion of mine, and I've actively found opportunities to be able to use finance in the "real world". Through internships and shadowing experiences, I've gained insights into business and financial literacy that I'm eager to share with others.</p>
    <p>Through my work with Lionheart Finances, I aspire to inspire others to develop the same enthusiasm for financial literacy that I've gained in my journey. My goal is to ensure that everyone has a strong foundation in financial literacy and the ability to make informed, responsible financial decisions.</p>

      <h3>Internship Experience</h3>
      <p>I've interned at Family Health Center (FHC), a non-profit hospital, to assist in the budgeting and marketing of their Back-to-School Bash. There, I learned how marketing and finance can be used to give back to the community.</p>

      <h3>Family History</h3>
      <p>As the child of two entrepreneurs, I've spent my whole life listening to my parents talk about money. As I've gotten older, I've witnessed how easy it is to misuse money, which has cemented in my mind the importance of having a basic understanding of personal finance. Because of this, I decided to leverage the power of the internet and make videos to help educate the uninformed.</p>

      <h3>Job Shadowing in the Field</h3>
      <p>I've job-shadowed multiple personal financial advisors at <a href="https://www.brightfinancialadvisors.com/">Bright Financial Advisors</a>. There, I gained information about financial literacy which sparked my desire to spread the lessons I've learned.</p>
